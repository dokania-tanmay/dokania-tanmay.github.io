Hey! I am a final year undergraduate at the Electrical Engineering Department of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/index.php), with a dual minor in [C-MInDS](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/) and [SysCon](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/).

My research interests lies in the use of learning-based control for dynamical systems. I am inclined for the incorporation of ideas from geometry for the design of controllers and estimators which are safe, scalable and efficient.

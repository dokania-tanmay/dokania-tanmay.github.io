- Designed a lead-lag compensator for active noise cancellation in a headphone after experimentally obtaining the Bode plot for the open loop system
- Achieved a 20dB attenuation at 100Hz with gain and phase margin of 10.2 dB and 50o respectively
- Designed a PID controller for a line-following robot to cover a track with redundant turnings in 30 secs
- Designed a set point tracking controller for a DC motor after smoothening the feedback

- Studied state-of-art formation control algorithms under position, distance, and bearing-based measurements
- Learned about concepts of bearing rigidity, minimal rigidity, and persistence for formations
- Designed bearing-based barrier functions to develop controller filters after partitioning the regions
- Developed ideas of smooth “AND” and “OR” for combining different barrier functions

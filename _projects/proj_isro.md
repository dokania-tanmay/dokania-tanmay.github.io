- Proposed a novel torque distribution function for singularity evasion after extensive literature review
- Developed understanding of different techniques used for the control of Control Moment Gyroscopes
- Examined singularities encountered due to alignment of CMGs and developed generalizations of new and old approaches in a common mathematical framework using geometrical insight
